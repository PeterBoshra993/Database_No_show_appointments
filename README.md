As we can see **14%** of **Females** that have scholarships not appeared at appointment Day and There's **6%** of **men** that has Scholarships(enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia) not appeared at appointment Day so We are pretty sure that having scholarship has strong impact on the appearance of patient.Our final shape of our data is there's 110519 rows (values"outliers removed") and 12 columns we removed The first 3 columns (PatientID, Appointment ID) We may need them if we were searching for a specific ID but here we don't want specific IDs we just want to do some Analysis!!!

[Here's a link to a mark down File extended Syntax review](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)

Also I should mention [Stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com/),[geeks for geeks](www.geeksforgeeks.org) and of course [github](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) as they helped me alot to remember some syntax besides did some rememorize from course lessons


### Limitation:-

- we may needed to divide dataframe by neighbourhoods and do some further analysis but we couldn't as there's a length of 81 value and it will take much longer time.

- There's also a needed data to specify which Sms-Message type is sent "Is it confirmation or a reminder?"


### Finally

- Maybe we can Predict which one will show and who won't but further data is needed
